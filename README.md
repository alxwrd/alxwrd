### Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I'm a software engineer based in Nottingham 🏹 in the UK.

I've been in software for almost a decade - originally coming from a background of call-center and customer service!

Currently, I am a Senior Full-Stack Software Engineer at <a href="https://joingelt.com"><img src="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/644009bcfc80736edfedda0f/64413882bab682eb86b2c480_gelt-logo-full.svg" height="14" alt="Gelt logo"></a>.

In my free time, you can find me either:
- 🧗 bouldering
- 🚵 mountain biking
- 🎮 making and playing video games
- 👨‍👩‍👧 or spending time with my family.

You can find me online at https://alxwrd.co.uk/
