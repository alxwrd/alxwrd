### Hi, I'm Alex 👋

I'm a software engineer based in Nottingham 🏹 in the UK.

I've been in software for almost 8 years - originally coming from a background of call-center and customer service!

Currently, I am a software engineer at [DeepSea](http://deepsea.ai). Previously, I've worked at Tessian and Oracle.

In my free time, you can find me either:
- bouldering
- mountain biking
- making and playing video games
- or spending time with my family.

You can find me online at https://alxwrd.co.uk/
